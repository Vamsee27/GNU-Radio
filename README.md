GNU Radio from scratch

To start as a beginner using GNU Radio, you should first familiarize yourself with the basics of digital signal processing and radio frequency (RF) technology. This can include concepts such as sampling rates, modulation techniques, and filtering.

Next, you should download and install GNU Radio onto your computer. This can be done by visiting the GNU Radio website and following the instructions for your specific operating system.

Once you have GNU Radio installed, you can begin experimenting with the various tools and blocks that come with the software. Some good resources for learning how to use GNU Radio include the official documentation, tutorials, and example flowgraphs that can be found on the GNU Radio website.

You can also use the GNU Radio companion (GRC) to design and test your own flowgraphs. GRC is a graphical tool that allows you to connect different blocks together to create a radio system.

It is also a good idea to practice with real-world signals. You can use a software defined radio (SDR) device, such as a HackRF or RTL-SDR, to capture live RF signals and test them with GNU Radio.
